# Django + React Learning Project

This project was built as a way for me to learn how to connect **React** with **Django** while also practicing **Tailwind CSS** for styling.  
It was developed in the past year and mainly focuses on authentication and basic pages integration.

## 🚀 Features
- **Authentication**: Sign in and Sign up pages.
- **Main Pages**:
  - Home page
  - About Us page
  - Courses page (⚠️ only displays courses; no learning/watching workflow implemented)
  - Contact Us page
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive UI.
